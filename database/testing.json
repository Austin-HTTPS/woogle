        "description": "You might have noticed that it's now possible to import your GitHub repos into repls. If you haven't yet, consider connecting your GitHub account to repl.it to make it easier to import and contribute back.  In this guide I'm going to show you how to configuring a repo to run on repl.it and how you can contribute back a neat \"run on repl.it\" button to the repo. It looks like this: I'm going to use this repo ( https://github.com/plibither8/2048.cpp ) as an example. (It's an implementation of 2048 in C++ that works in the terminal!) First let's import the repo to repl.it. Click \"import repo\" from the header. Then add in the repo url: Click \"create from GitHub\" and after the repo clones you'll see a configuration pane to figure out the language",
